## Personal Note

I wish I could have taken this course when I first started learning programming. If I could do it again, I would definitely take more foundational courses like this one. It's not boring at all—in fact, it makes you want to keep studying! 👍 I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn computer science. 👍👍 🚀
